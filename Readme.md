# Camera tracking with OpenCV

## Corner detection
* Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector
* Lucasâ€“Kanade Optical Flow
* Conrer detection on multiple scales
* Additional corner quality metrics

## Camera tracking
* Initial position initialisation using essential matrix
* EPnP with RANSAC for position solving
* Triangulation with RANSAC for triangulating multiple frames
* Bundle adjustment with autograd by jax
